# CPlusHeaven
In this project, I am implementing a project from Stephen ultimate 
C++ Unreal Engine 4 course.

Comments in source are appreciated.

Specify author annotation in every single C++ header you have created - that is the law. 
That can also do version control system, but when sources changing several times, it getting trickier to track the original source author.
